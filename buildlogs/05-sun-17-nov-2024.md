## Before

wit.nana should be even easier to run than prelude.nana so I might start there.

- [ ] Record
  - builtin because it's a base type
- [ ] Variant builtin
  - builtin because it's a base type

I'm thinking for now that records and variants will just be for structure and
wit generation. I won't bother with type checking.

## During

I'll start with parsing. There's a couple of cljs parser combinator libraries.
Hopefully they don't do anything that'll trip up the component compiler.
