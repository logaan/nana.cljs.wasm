## Before

I want to parse the first line:

``` haskell
Package nana:example@0.0.1
```

But even that is a bit of a rabit hole. Tokenising and the initial parse is ok. We end up with:

``` clojure
    [(MacroName. "Package")
     (Name. "nana:example@0.0.1")]
```

But I'd like to take it one step forward, almost to where we would be if we just
used lisp syntax for macros:

``` clojure
    [(Macro "Package"
            [(Name. "nana:example@0.0.1")])]
```

To get there we need:

1. To look up the MacroName package in the environment

2. Which means we need an environment. A map should be fine:

    ``` clojure
    {"Package" (.Macro [name] ...)}
    ```

3. And the definition of the macro. It could be a builtin but I don't think it
needs to be. Maybe something like:

    ``` haskell
    Macro "Package" [name]
        Let [package package{name: name}]
            Def _wit
                If (defined? "_wit")
                    (set _wit "package" package)
                    wit{package: package}
    ```

- `Macro` is a Macro. It'll probably evalaute to a `Def` in order to name the
thing. Actually storing the name of the thing inside the thing would be bad
because things can be `Def` to several different names.

- I don't like that we define functions like `Func foo` but macros like `Macro
"Foo"`.

- Is it ok to have `foo:` for record keys? As bad as strings
