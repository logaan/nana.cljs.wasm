## Why restart nana

I've become frustraited with the js/ts ecosystem. Node and JCO seem to want different js module systems.

Also js/ts as a language. Interfaces not being checkable at runtime makes it hard to build on top of them. Not having tagged variants means you end up rolling your own. It all feels inelegant.

## The plan

I'm going to:

1. Follow the [figwheel instructions](https://figwheel.org/#quick-usage) for setting up a project.
2. Set up some kind of autotest suite
3. Get a wasm component hello world build pipeline going
4. Grab a library, or write a simple parser combinator
5. Parse fizzbuzz written in my new nana syntax
