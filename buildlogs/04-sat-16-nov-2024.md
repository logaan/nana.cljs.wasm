## Before

Just going to try coding the record stuff discussed yesterday.

## During

- If the wit is going to be a record then it would be nice if it was always a
valid one. I guess technically just a package name is probably a valid wit.

### Need to define

- [ ] Macro
  - builtin because otherwise so much else would need to be defined
- [ ] Def
  - builtin because otherwise all macros would have access to an env resource
- [ ] Quote
  - builtin because otherwise so much else would need to be defined
- [ ] Unquote
  - builtin because otherwise so much else would need to be defined
- [ ] string
  - builtin because it's a fundamental transformation between base types
- [ ] nana:wit/package
